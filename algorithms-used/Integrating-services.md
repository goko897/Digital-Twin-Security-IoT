## **1. Security Monitoring Algorithms**  

### **ðŸ”¹ Log Analysis Algorithm (Used in Wazuh & ELK Stack)**  
**Purpose:** Detect suspicious activity from log files.  

#### **Pseudocode:**  
```plaintext
Input: Log files from Ditto services  
Output: Security alerts for suspicious activity  

1. Initialize a log parser  
2. For each log entry in the input logs:
    a. Extract fields (timestamp, event type, source IP, etc.)
    b. Check for known attack patterns:
       - If event contains "Failed Login" > 5 times in 10 minutes, flag as "Brute Force"
       - If event matches malware signatures, flag as "Malware Detected"
       - If IP address appears in blocklist, flag as "Suspicious IP"
    c. Send alerts to Wazuh  
3. Store processed logs in Elasticsearch for further analysis  
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Vulnerability Scanning Algorithm (Used in OpenVAS & Shodan API)**  
**Purpose:** Scan Ditto's infrastructure for vulnerabilities.  

#### **Pseudocode:**  
```plaintext
Input: Target system (Ditto services, IoT devices)  
Output: Vulnerability report  

1. Load latest vulnerability database (CVE, OWASP Top 10)  
2. For each service in Ditto:
    a. Perform port scanning using Nmap  
    b. Identify running services and versions  
    c. Compare with known vulnerabilities  
    d. If a vulnerability is found, generate a report  
3. Send results to Wazuh for alerting  
```

## **2. IoT/SCADA Security Testing Algorithms**  

### **ðŸ”¹ Bluetooth Security Testing (BLE-CTF)**
**Purpose:** Identify vulnerabilities in Bluetooth connections.  

#### **Pseudocode:**  
```plaintext
Input: Bluetooth devices in range  
Output: Security vulnerabilities in Bluetooth devices  

1. Scan for active Bluetooth devices  
2. For each device:
    a. Attempt device pairing  
    b. Check if default PINs work (e.g., "0000", "1234")  
    c. Try known exploits (e.g., BLE MITM attacks)  
3. Log results and send to Wazuh  
```

### **ðŸ”¹ CoAP Security Testing (CoAPthon)**
**Purpose:** Test security of CoAP-based IoT communication.  

#### **Pseudocode:**  
```plaintext
Input: CoAP server URL  
Output: Security assessment report  

1. Send a test request to CoAP server  
2. Check for improper authentication responses  
3. Attempt payload injection attacks  
4. Log successful attacks and notify security team  
```

## **3. Forensic Analysis Algorithms**  

### **ðŸ”¹ Incident Detection Algorithm (Used in Velociraptor & GRR)**  
**Purpose:** Identify and analyze security incidents on endpoints.  

#### **Pseudocode:**  
```plaintext
Input: System logs, memory dump  
Output: Incident report  

1. Collect system logs and process memory  
2. Extract indicators of compromise (IOCs):
    a. Unusual processes (e.g., unexpected PowerShell scripts)
    b. Unauthorized network connections  
    c. Suspicious file modifications  
3. Cross-check with threat intelligence feeds  
4. If suspicious activity is detected:
    a. Isolate the affected system  
    b. Generate an incident response report  
    c. Notify security team  
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Timeline Analysis Algorithm (Used in Timesketch)**
**Purpose:** Create forensic timelines from collected logs.  

#### **Pseudocode:**  
```plaintext
Input: System event logs, network traffic logs  
Output: Structured forensic timeline  

1. Parse logs and extract timestamps  
2. Categorize events (e.g., login attempts, file access)  
3. Sort events in chronological order  
4. Identify anomalies in user behavior  
5. Generate a visual forensic timeline for analysis  
```

## **4. Network Security Algorithms**  

### **ðŸ”¹ Network Packet Analysis (Used in Arkime for PCAP Analysis)**  
**Purpose:** Detect network attacks and anomalies.  

#### **Pseudocode:**  
```plaintext
Input: Captured network packets  
Output: Alerts for suspicious traffic  

1. Capture network packets in real-time  
2. Analyze packet headers for:
    a. Unusual source/destination IPs  
    b. High traffic volume from a single source (DDoS detection)  
    c. Known malware communication patterns  
3. If suspicious packet is found:
    a. Log event and alert security team  
    b. Block malicious traffic if needed  
```
